    <h2>Recent Season & League Status</h2>
    <p>
      In the 2024‑2025 campaign, Sampdoria finished **18th in Serie B**, which placed them in one of the automatic relegation spots. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
    </p>
    <p>
      However, due to off‑field issues affecting other clubs (notably Brescia’s points deduction), Sampdoria were given a lifeline: a relegation play‑off vs Salernitana. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>
    <p class="important">
      Sampdoria **avoided relegation to Serie C** after the second leg of the play‑off was abandoned due to crowd trouble. They are staying in **Serie B** for the next season. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>

    <h2>Management and Financial Situation</h2>
    <p>
      The club has seen several managerial changes. They began the season with Andrea Pirlo as head coach but later changed leadership in attempts to avoid relegation. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
    </p>
    <p>
      Financial difficulties have also troubled the club: they posted a loss of ~€40.7 million in 2024 accounts, and have had concerns over sustainability and stability in recent seasons. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
    </p>

    <h2>Outlook & Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining stability in Serie B to avoid a further fall into Serie C.</li>
      <li>Managing finances so that debts and losses don’t force severe sanctions or further points deductions.</li>
      <li>Improving performance and consistency on the pitch, especially avoiding the relegation zone.</li>
      <li>Potential restructuring of the squad, coaching, or ownership to restore competitive strength. </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <footer>
    <p>Hopefully they go back to Serie A this year.</p>
