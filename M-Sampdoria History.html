    <h1>History of Sampdoria</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p><strong>U.C. Sampdoria</strong> was founded in 1946 through the merger of two clubs: Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria, both based in Genoa, Italy.</p>

    <p>The club’s most successful era came in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Under manager Vujadin Boškov, Sampdoria won their only <strong>Serie A title in 1990–91</strong>.</p>

    <p>They also claimed <strong>4 Coppa Italia</strong> titles and reached the <strong>European Cup final in 1992</strong>, narrowly losing to Barcelona at Wembley.</p>

    <p>Sampdoria plays at the historic <strong>Stadio Luigi Ferraris</strong>, which they share with local rivals Genoa C.F.C.</p>
    
    <p>Despite recent challenges, the club remains a beloved symbol of Genoa’s football tradition.</p>
