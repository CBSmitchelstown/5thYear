<p>For much of Liverpool's history, its home colours have been all red. When the club was founded in 1892, blue and white quartered shirts were used until the club adopted the city's colour of red in 1896.[2] The city's symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the club's badge (or crest, as it is sometimes known) in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all-red strip.Anfield is the home of Liverpool Football Club, a legendary stadium in Liverpool known for its intense atmosphere and iconic Kop terrace, where fans sing "You'll Never Walk Alone" to support the team. Originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, the club's founder, John Houlding, established Liverpool FC at Anfield in 1892, and the ground has since undergone numerous expansions, including the recent Anfield Road Stand, to be one of England's largest football stadiums</p>

<p>Liverpool Football Club, commonly referred to as Liverpool or Liverpool Football Club Women if distinguishing themselves from the men's team, is a professional English women's football team based in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. They have served as the official women's division of Liverpool Football Club since 1994. Founded in 1989 as Newton LFC and subsequently renamed Knowsley United WFC, Liverpool Ladies and Liverpool FC Women over the years. The club was a founding member of the top-tier Women's Super League in 2011. A year later, Liverpool became the first English football club to offer every female player full-time professional contracts.[1] This decision pioneered the professionalisation of women's football in England and led to Liverpool winning back to back Women's Super League titles in 2013[2] and 2014.[3] In 2022, they also won the FA Women's Championship, earning promotion back to the Women's Super League, having done so three times previously in 2003–04, 2006–07, 2009–10.</p>
