      <h2>üèõ Origins of Golf (Pre-15th Century)</h2>
      <p>
        The roots of golf can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Evidence suggests that early stick-and-ball games were played in China (chuiwan), the Roman Empire (paganica), and the Netherlands (colf). While these games were not identical to modern golf, they involved elements of hitting a ball with a club over a distance.

      <h2>‚õ≥ Scotland: The Birthplace of Modern Golf (15th - 17th Century)</h2>
      <p>
        Golf, as we know it, began in Scotland during the 15th century. The first written record of golf dates to 1457 when King James II banned the game because it was distracting soldiers from archery practice. By the 16th century, golf had gained popularity among the Scottish elite, and in 1552, the town of St Andrews officially recognized the right to play golf on its links.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Course at St Andrews became the spiritual home of golf. The 18-hole round was standardized there in 1764.

      <h2>üåç Global Spread & Evolution (18th - 19th Century)</h2>
      <p>
        The 18th century saw the formation of the first golf clubs and rules. The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (1744) wrote the first official rules. Golf spread to England and across the British Empire, eventually reaching the United States by the late 19th century.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first women's golf club was founded in 1867 (Ladies' Golf Club at St Andrews). In 1894, the United States Golf Association (USGA) was formed, laying the foundation for American golf.

      <h2>üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Rise of Professional Golf (20th Century)</h2>
      <p>
        The 20th century marked a transformative era. Legendary players like Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen, Ben Hogan, and later Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus brought golf into the mainstream. The PGA Tour was established in 1929, and televised golf in the 1950s brought the game to global audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equipment technology advanced rapidly, with metal woods, graphite shafts, and better ball designs. The modern major championships became central: The Masters, U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship.

      <h2>üì∫ Golf in the Digital Age (21st Century)</h2>
      <p>
        With Tiger Woods' explosive rise in the late 1990s and 2000s, golf reached unprecedented levels of popularity. Golfers became global celebrities, and sponsorships and prize purses grew exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology such as launch monitors, GPS rangefinders, and VR training have redefined the sport. Online streaming and social media now make golf accessible to millions worldwide, 24/7.

      <h2>üåê Golf Today & The Future</h2>
      <p>
        Golf is played by over 60 million people in more than 200 countries. Sustainability, accessibility, and innovation are key themes today. New formats like Topgolf and simulator golf attract younger audiences, while traditional formats continue to thrive through major tours and international competitions like the Ryder Cup and Solheim Cup.
      </p>
      <p>
        As golf adapts to a rapidly changing world, it remains deeply rooted in history, honor, and the spirit of the game.
